## About This Repository
This repository is where all of my C# challenges and projects are kept. They are each labeled according to what I was tasked with at the time. I learned about methods, different ways to use strings, method overloading, math operations, booleans, branching, classes and inheritence, DateTime, and so much more.

## Twenty One
Made a console application of the classic game 21, aka Blackjack! Completely playable console game. Asks the players name then how much money they brought. Asks the player each round how much they would like to bet. Gives proper payouts. The game knows when the dealer busts and when the dealer draws blackjack. Uses a function to shuffle the deck each round, so you cant count cards. Asks if you want to continue playing every round. Its pretty fun to play for a console application, and I learned so much from it. 

## Shipping Quote Application
Console application for a possible shipping company to give you a quote. Asks the user for the weight and dimensions of the package to be shipt. Uses an if statement to determine if the package is lighter than 50 lbs. If so, it asks for the dimensions. If not, it tells you its too heavy to ship. Another if statement checks if your width + height + length is below 50. If so, it tells you the cost to ship the package. If not, the programs says a message and quits.

## Daily Report Submission
Console application for a user to give a daily report. Asks the user for their name, program, and page number. Then asks if the user needs extra help with anything, any positive experiences or other feedback. Lastly, it asks for hours studied that day. Then thanks you and exits.
